GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the GNOME
desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME
is not installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.

GConf does require glib and ORBit.  It has optional ldap and xml backends
that require openldap and libxml respectively.

For information, see:
 http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/

There's a mailing list gconf-list@gnome.org, see
http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gconf-list.

The GConf maintainer is Havoc Pennington <hp@redhat.com>. Bugs and
patches should be filed in Bugzilla, http://bugzilla.gnome.org,
against the GConf product. Send questions and comments to Havoc or to
gconf-list@gnome.org.
